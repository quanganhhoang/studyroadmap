## Step 1: Define your study aboard goals

1. What are you looking for in a college/university?
    This first step is extremely crucial as parents and students usually get carried away with grades and monetary costs and whatever everyone else is doing, rather than asking themselves what it is that they are looking for.

    Take a step back, ask yourselves these questions. Then we will carry on to step 2 to 
    [Four Important Things to Consider When Choosing A College](#)

2. Liberal Arts vs. University
    There are two types of colleges in the United States, one of which provides much more support for need-based financial aid to its students. Please follow this [link](#) to understand more about their strengths and differences.

    Once you have a rough idea of which type of college is a better fit for you. Continue on to the next step! 

## Step 2: Select your schools

1. Pick your top schools
    
    Take a look at this list [Best Colleges](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges) to find the top schools of your choice. Remember to align it with your priorities in Step 1!

2. Pick your reach schools
    
    It doesn't hurt to always dream high! This is exactly why I made this roadmap and why you are following this platform, aren't you!? Again, let's remind ourselves that the best schools are not necessarily the ones with the highest test score requirements. They are ones that align with your priorities but maybe your goals haven't necessarily matched with their standards yet.

3. Pick your safety schools
    
    This will be safety net in case you might have been rejected or you might not have scored the amount of scholarship you expected. These are the schools that will both give you a great education but not empty your pockets!
